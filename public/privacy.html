            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 10, 2025<br>
            <strong style="color: #DC2626;">⚠️ PRIVACY POLICY UPDATED - Please Review Changes</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> We use IP-based geolocation ONLY to verify you're not in a prohibited country. We immediately delete this data. All other data stays on your device. We don't track your precise location or store personal information.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            DrinkBot3000 ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our Core Privacy Principle:</strong> Your data is YOUR data. We designed DrinkBot3000 to work entirely on your device with minimal data collection (one-time country verification only for legal compliance).
        </p>

        <h2>2. IP-Based Geographic Verification (Legal Compliance)</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>🌍 Why We Check Your Country:</strong></p>
            <p>
                To comply with international laws, we perform a one-time check to verify you are not accessing this app from a country where alcohol consumption is illegal. This is required for legal compliance, not surveillance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.1 What We Check</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>âœ" <strong>IP Address:</strong> We check your IP address against a country database (one time only)</li>
            <li>âœ" <strong>Country Only:</strong> We only determine your country, NOT your city, address, or precise location</li>
            <li>âœ" <strong>Purpose:</strong> To block access from countries where alcohol is prohibited by law</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 How We Protect Your Privacy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>🔒 <strong>Immediate Deletion:</strong> Your IP address is checked and immediately deleted - we do NOT store it</li>
            <li>🔒 <strong>No Logging:</strong> We do NOT log, save, or track your IP address</li>
            <li>🔒 <strong>No GPS:</strong> We do NOT access your device's GPS or precise location</li>
            <li>🔒 <strong>No Tracking:</strong> This is NOT used for analytics, advertising, or user tracking</li>
            <li>🔒 <strong>One-Time Only:</strong> The check happens once when you first access the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Third-Party Geolocation Service</h3>
        <p>We use a third-party IP geolocation service to determine country only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service:</strong> IP-API.com (or similar privacy-respecting service)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Shared:</strong> Only your IP address (automatically sent with any web request)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Received:</strong> Only country code (e.g., "US", "UK", "CA")</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://ip-api.com/docs/legal" target="_blank">https://ip-api.com/docs/legal</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.4 Your Rights</h3>
        <p>
            This geographic check is <strong>required for legal compliance</strong>. If you do not consent:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may not use this app</li>
            <li>You should close the app immediately</li>
            <li>You will see a clear consent dialog before any check is performed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>Beyond the one-time country verification described above, we want to be crystal clear about what we DON'T do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT collect your name, email, or phone number</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT track your precise location (GPS, city, street address)</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT store your IP address</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT collect your drinking history</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT collect your BAC calculations</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT collect your weight or gender information</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT track your app usage</li>

            <li>âŒ We do NOT use advertising networks</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT sell your data (because we don't have any)</li>
            <li>âŒ We do NOT share data with third parties (because we don't have any)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How the App Works (Locally)</h2>

            <li>âœ“ Your age verification status</li>
            <li>âœ“ Your disclaimer acceptance</li>
            <li>âœ“ Your app preferences</li>

            <li>Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe, Inc.</strong>, a third-party payment processor</li>

            <li>Stripe collects payment information according to their own privacy policy: <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li>We only receive confirmation that payment was successful</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data security depends on your device's security (use passcode/biometrics)</li>
            <li>We cannot access your data even if we wanted to</li>
            <li>There is no "server" to hack because we don't have servers</li>
            <li>Your data is as secure as your device is</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
