                <li><strong>Method:</strong> IP-based geolocation (determines country only, not precise location within USA)</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> One-time check when you first access the app</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your IP address is NOT stored; see our Privacy Policy for full details</li>

                <li>You are at least 21 years of age</li>
                <li>You have not falsified your age during verification</li>
