            <em>Note: The 5-10 day timeline for funds appearing in your account depends on your bank/card issuer's processing time, not us.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>5. Refund Method</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Original Payment Method</h3>
        <p>Refunds are issued to the <strong>same payment method</strong> used for the original contribution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Credit card â†’ Refunded to same credit card</li>
            <li>Debit card â†’ Refunded to same debit card</li>
            <li>Digital wallet â†’ Refunded to same wallet</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Expired Cards</h3>
        <p>
            If your original payment card has expired or is no longer valid:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:drinkbot3000@gmail.com">drinkbot3000@gmail.com</a></li>
            <li>We'll work with you to arrange an alternative refund method</li>
            <li>Options may include: check, PayPal, bank transfer</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Processing Fees</h2>

        <h3>6.1 We Absorb the Fees</h3>
        <div class="guarantee">
            <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>You get a FULL refund - we don't deduct processing fees.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>6.2 How It Works</h3>
        <p>When you make a contribution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You pay: $10 (example)</li>
            <li>Stripe charges us: $0.59 (2.9% + $0.30)</li>
            <li>We receive: $9.41</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When we issue a refund:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You receive back: $10 (full amount)</li>
            <li>Stripe keeps: $0.59 (they don't refund processing fees)</li>
            <li>Our cost: $0.59 (we absorb this)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> You get 100% of your money back. We cover the Stripe fees because we value your trust and support.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>7. After the 30-Day Window</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Standard Policy</h3>
        <p>
            After 30 days from the date of contribution, refunds are generally not available. The 30-day window is clearly stated at the time of contribution.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2 Exceptional Circumstances</h3>
        <p>
            However, we understand that exceptional situations arise. If you have a special circumstance beyond the 30-day window:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:drinkbot3000@gmail.com">drinkbot3000@gmail.com</a></li>
            <li>Explain your situation</li>
            <li>We'll evaluate on a case-by-case basis</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Examples of exceptional circumstances:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical emergency that prevented timely request</li>
            <li>Unauthorized transaction</li>
            <li>Technical error or duplicate charge</li>
            <li>Other genuine hardship situations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While we can't guarantee refunds after 30 days, we're reasonable people and will do our best to help.</p>

        <h2>8. Chargebacks</h2>

        <h3>8.1 Please Contact Us First</h3>
        <div class="important">
            <p>
                <strong>Before filing a chargeback with your bank, please contact us first.</strong> We offer hassle-free refunds and it's much faster than the chargeback process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>8.2 Chargeback Process</h3>
        <p>If you file a chargeback:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can take 60-90 days to resolve (vs. 2-3 days for our refund)</li>
            <li>Your bank may charge you fees</li>
            <li>We may charge additional chargeback processing fees</li>
            <li>It creates unnecessary work for both of us</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.3 Our Commitment</h3>
        <p>
            We will ALWAYS issue a refund if requested within 30 days. There's no need for chargebacks. Just email us and we'll handle it immediately.
        </p>

            <li>Each receipt has a unique ID (e.g., DBT-1699385612345-A7K2M9P3Q)</li>

        <h2>12. Our Philosophy</h2>

        <div class="guarantee">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #059669;">Why We Offer Such a Generous Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
                DrinkBot3000 is a passion project focused on promoting safety and responsible drinking. Optional contributions help cover development costs and keep the app free for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'd rather give you a refund and part as friends than have you feel pressured or regretful about supporting us. Your trust matters more than money.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>If you're not happy, we're not happy.</strong> Simple as that.
            </p>
        </div>
