## 🎯 Three Simple Steps

### 1️⃣ Run the Deploy Script

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Windows:**
```
deploy.bat
```

**What this does:**
- Installs all dependencies
- Builds your production-ready app
- Creates a `build` folder

### 2️⃣ Go to Netlify Drop

Visit: **https://app.netlify.com/drop**

### 3️⃣ Drag & Drop

Drag the entire **`build`** folder onto the Netlify Drop page.

**DONE!** Your site is live! 🎉
